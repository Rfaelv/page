## Introduction

InstabiliTool is a app developed using Python and the framework [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) in order to facilitate the process of run stability analysis in Ansys. Due to a big range of possibilities and resources that the software Ansys offer, sometimes the interest in some specific analysis, like stability, can be hard to perform because of the difficulty in the input data. Also, sometimes it is necessary to run a set of analysis with several profile dimension, so this task can be extremely difficult with a not friendly GUI of drawing. Then, the aim of this work is to give a GUI application that offer to the users an easy and friendly way to run buckling analysis in profiles modeled with shell elements using ANSYS in background. The developed program allows a large range of possibilities of section shapes without needing any draw by the user. The application was developed using Python Language and the framework Electron and can perform linear and non-linear analysis with normal and bending loads. Moreover, was carefully developed to be easy to use to facilitate access and speed up numerical analysis of buckling for researchers and other interested people.
